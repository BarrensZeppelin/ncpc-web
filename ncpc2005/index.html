<p>
    The rules for this contest is given by the 
    <a href="http://icpc.baylor.edu/icpc/regionals/About.htm">ICPC 
    regional contest rules</a>, with the following clarifications and
    additions.
</p>

<h4>Who may compete</h4>

<p>
    <i>Note:</i> The old &ldquo;grandfather&rdquo; rule is no longer effective.
    This means that there is no limit on the number of 4th/5th-graders on a
    team.
</p>

<p>
    Basically, any student who started his/her university/college studies in
    2001 or later is eligible to compete. For exceptions such as retaken
    years, military service and so on, please see the <a
    href="http://icpc.baylor.edu/icpc/regionals/About.htm">ICPC regional
    contest rules</a>. Those who have competed in five regional finals (<a
    href="http://www.nada.kth.se/contest/nwerc/">NWERC</a>) already, or two
    world finals, may not compete.
</p>


<h4>What you may bring to the contest floor</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Any written material (Books, manuals, handwritten notes, printed notes, etc).</li>
    <li>Pens, pencils, blank paper, stapler and other useful non-electronic 
        office equipment.</li>
    <li>NO material in electronic form (CDs, USB pen and so on).</li>
    <li>NO electronic devices (Cellular phone, PDA and so on).</li>
</ul>


<h4>Behaviour during the contest</h4>

<p>
    Contestants are <i>only</i> allowed to communicate with members of their
    own team, and the organisers of the contest. The only electronic equipment
    they can use is their assigned team computer. The only remote electronic
    content they may access is what is made available by the local organiser,
    such as programming language APIs and compiler manuals. This means the 
    only network traffic the contestants may generate is from the use of PC^2
    for submitting their problem solutions, and access to web-pages specified 
    by the local organisers. This means you may <i>not</i> read your e-mail or
    chat with your aunt on MSN.
</p>

<h4>The contest</h4>

<p>
    The problem set consists of a number of problems (usually 8-12). 
    The problem set will be in English, 
    and given to the participating teams when the contest begins.
    For each of these problems, you are to write a program in C, C++ or Java
    that reads from standard input (stdin) 
    and writes to standard output (stdout), unless otherwise stated. 
    After you have written a solution,
    you may submit it using the <a href="http://www.ecs.csus.edu/pc2/">PC^2</a>
    system. See the 
    <a href="http://www.ecs.csus.edu/pc2/doc/v85/team/PC2TeamGuide.htm">PC^2
    Contestants Guide</a> for details.
</p>

<p>
    The team that solves the most problems correctly wins. If two teams solve 
    the same number of problems, the one with the lowest total time wins.
    If two top teams end up with the same number of problems solved and the
    same total time, then the team with the lowest time on a single problem is
    ranked higher. If two teams solve the same number of problems, with the same
    total time, and the same time on all problems, it is a draw. The time for
    a given problem is the time from the beginning of the contest to the time
    when the first correct solution was submitted, plus 20 minutes for each
    incorrect submission of that problem. The total time is the sum of the times
    for all solved problems, meaning you will not get extra time for a problem
    you never submit a correct solution to.
</p>

<p>
    If you feel that problem definition is ambiguous, you may submit a 
    clarification request via the PC^2 system. If the judges think there is no
    ambiguity, you will get a short answer stating this. Otherwise, the 
    judges will write a clarification, that will be sent to all teams at all 
    sites in the contest.
