The Nordic Collegiate Programming Contest (NCPC) is an annual team-based programming competition aimed at university and college students from the Nordic and Baltic countries. NCPC is suitable for programmers of all skill levels, from beginner to expert. The contest features a well-rounded problem set with a mix of easy and challenging problems.

Each university hosts their own local site. Scoreboards are maintained for local sites, national level, and the overall contest, giving participants the opportunity to compare their performance against others at their desired level of competition. Professional teams (with team members not enrolled at a university) are also welcome to participate.
