<h1>Registration Process</h1>
<a href=".">Back to NCPC 2021</a>
<p>The NCPC registration uses the official ICPC registration system. To register a team follow this registration guide. <b>All teams should register through the ICPC system, even those that are not <a href="https://icpc.global/regionals/rules#HPeriodofEligibility">ICPC eligible</a>.</b>
</p>

<p><b>Step 0:</b><br />
      Either the team must have a <b>Coach</b> (i.e. somebody that is not competing, typically a faculty member), or one of the team members has to be a <b>Student Coach</b>. It is the [Student] Coach that registers the team.
</p>

<p><b>Step 1 (create an ICPC-account if you don't have one):</b><br />
The [Student] Coach needs to have an ICPC-account. If you have participated before you most likely already have an ICPC-account, otherwise you need to create one.<br />To create an ICPC-account:
  <ol>
    <li>Click on the "Sign up"-button on the <a href="https://icpc.global/">main ICPC-page</a>.</li>
    <li>Fill in all the required fields. Your email address will be your unique username.</li>
    <li>In the Institution field just start typing the name of your university. You will get suggestion for universities that match. Click on your university.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p><b>Step 2 (log in):</b><br />
      If you just created an account in step 1 above you will already be logged in, otherwise:
  <ol>
    <li>Click <a href="https://icpc.global/private/dashboard">here</a>. (Or click on the "Login"-link on the <a href="https://icpc.global/" target="_blank">main ICPC-page</a>).</li>
    <li>Fill in your email and password and click "Sign in".</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p><b>Step 3 (register your team):</b><br />
  Go to the <a href="https://icpc.global/regionals/finder/Nordic-2020">NCPC 2020 site</a>:
  <ol>
    <li>Click the "Register"-button.</li>
    <li>Choose the site you want to participate from (your University) </li>
    <li>Create your team:<br />
      <ol>
        <li>If you are a Student Coach check the "I also want to participate as contestant" box, and remove the first team in the list of teams to register.</li>
        <li>Your university should already be filled in.</li>
        <li>If you are a student coach, don't fill in yourself as the another team member (otherwise the system will complain you are in the team twice)</li>
        <li>Fill in your team name (this can be changed later)</li>
        <li>Add team members</li>
        <ol>
          <li>For each member in your team:<br />
          <li>In the team member field write the email address of the team member</li>
          <li>If the page does not give you your team member as a suggestion you can also register the team member directly.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Finally do the actual registration:<br />     
        <ol>
          <li>Click the "Register Team"-button.</li>
          <li>Click "OK" in the confirmation dialog.</li>
        </ol>
        <li><b>But wait! There is more!</b> Enter whether the team is ICPC-eligible or not:<br />
        <ol>
          <li>Click "Contest-Specific Fields" in the middle tab</li>
          <li>Enter "YES" or "NO" in the ICPC-eligible field</li>
          <li>Click the "Update Contest-Specific Fields"-button</li>
        </ol>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>
