<h1>Resolved issues</h1>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>

<p>
<i>
Students eligible for NWERC will be allowed to compete in the Nordic and 
national championships. All sites are allowed to have local contestants not 
participating in the championships. These will have a special tag in their 
team name, which the score-table spider will recognise.
</i>
</p>

<h2>Event name</h2>

<p>
What should be the long and short names of the events? Currently there is a
name clash in the abbreviation of Nordisk M(e/ä)sterskap and Norsk Mesterskap.
</p>

<p>
<i>
The name of the Nordic Event is the Nordic Collegiate Programming Contest
(NCPC).  
</i>
</p>

<h2>Contest software architecture</h2>

<p>Responsible: Open</p>

<p>
<b>Tightly coupled PC^2</b>:<br />
+ Very fair to contestants. Same start time, clarifications, and so on.<br />
+ Smaller sites do not need to judge their own runs.<br />
- Sites are not free to choose how to arrange their contest.<br />
- Need wrapper scripts for compiling.<br />
- Distributed judging gives problems with differences between UNIX and 
  Windows environment for C/C++. (Not really a problem.)<br />
<br />
<!--
[Comment: This is not the same as a tightly coupled multi-site contest
in the PC<sup>2</sup> manual. The manual describes it as having a
server at every site. The servers synchronize their databases somehow
(global definitions of problems and languages, clarifications are
global, judging can be global if one wants that, team list is
local). If a server goes 
down the others CAN go on, and the stopped server can be restarted
(with assistans from any one of the other sites).

</p>

<p>
<b>PC^2 run locally, results merged by spider</b>:<br />
+ Very fault tolerant.<br />
- You risk clarifications not reaching all sites if this is not handled 
  carefully.<br />
</p>

<p>
<b>Heterogeneous setup</b>: (One master site, some tightly coupled, 
                             some stand-alone/non-PC^2)<br />
+ Sites are free to decide how to run their contest.<br />
- Complex. Difficult to keep track of who does what and how.<br />
</p>

<p>
<i>
The sites at which it is possible, will run tightly couled PC^2. A spider 
will collect results from sites which cannot or do not want to run tightly 
coupled. 
</i>
</p>

<h2>ICPC tree</h2>

<p>
Responsible: Roy Anderson.
</p>

<p>
It is generally agreed that the Nordic events should get into the ICPC contest
tree, as this gives several benefits. It is not clear how this is to be done.
Two possible solutions are:
</p>

<p>
<b>Norden is made an ICPC subregion. The national events are virtual.</b>
</p>

<p>
<b>Each Nordic country is made a subregion. The Nordic event is virtual.</b>
<br />
+ We would probably get more slots for teams from NWERC in the world finals.
  <br />
- Denmark, Finland and Iceland might not be big enough to become subregions.
  We are not even sure if there will be events there.<br />
</p>

<p>
<i>
The NCPC was made a subregion of NWERC.
</i>
</p>

<h2>Results of tightly coupled test 2005-03-06</h2>
<p>
On Sunday March 6th we tested setting up PC<sup>2</sup> in tightly
coupled congiguration. We had 5 sites represented: Trondheim (Nils),
Molde (Hans), Oslo (Erek), Umeå (Tomas) and Stockholm (Fredrik, Per,
Mattias, Mikael).
</p>

<h4>Short version</h4>
<p>
Molde and Oslo could not connect due to NAT and a firewall
respectively. Trondheim, Umeå and Stockholm went on to run the test
and it worked well. See the <a href="pc2test050306.html">full
report</a>
for more details.
</p>

<h4>What's next</h4>
<p>
We knew that Firewalls and NAT would cause problems and also that
these problems can be solved using a VPN. Or perhaps we can get around
it if enough machines at each site are outside NAT and firewalls. At
Lund I think the student machines are outside NAT and firewalls.
</p>

<ul>
<li>KTH and NTNU should approach the PC2-people in Shanghai and ask
about their VPN-solution</li>
<li>Find out which sites are NAT:ed or  behind firewalls, and if there
are possibilities of getting "outside" NAT and firewalls there.</li>
<li>Run another test, preferably in April trying a VPN</li>
</ul>

<h2>Rules</h2>
<p>
For simplicity, we should use the rules from the ICPC regional contests. But
are there any exceptions. Do we for example want to allow the teams to 
bring any reference material?
</p>

<p>
<i>
We use the rules from the regional contest, except that the contestants may 
bring any written material.
