		  <h1>Registration Process</h1>
		  <p>The NCPC registration uses the official ICPC registration system. To register a team follow this registration guide. <b>All teams should register through the ICPC system, even those that are not <a href="https://icpc.baylor.edu/regionals/rules#HPeriodofEligibility">ICPC eligible</a>.</b>
		  </p>

		  <p><b>Step 0:</b><br />
		  	Either the team must have a <b>Coach</b> (i.e. somebody that is not competing, typically a faculty member), or one of the team members has to be a <b>Student Coach</b>. It is the [Student] Coach that registers the team.
		  </p>

		  <p><b>Step 1 (create an ICPC-account if you don't have one):</b><br />
		  The [Student] Coach needs to have an ICPC-account. If you have participated before you most likely already have an ICPC-account, otherwise you need to create one.<br />To create an ICPC-account:
		    <ol>
		      <li>Click <a href="https://icpc.baylor.edu/auth/realms/cm5/login-actions/registration?client_id=cm5-frontend&tab_id=PqrvHRHgpuk">here</a>. (Or click on the "Sign up"-button on the <a href="http://icpc.baylor.edu/">main ICPC-page</a>).</li>
		      <li>Fill in all the required fields. Your email address will be your unique username.</li>
		      <li>In the Institution field just start typing the name of your university. You will get suggestion for universities that match. Click on your university.</li>
		  </ol>
		  </p>

		  <p><b>Step 2 (log in):</b><br />
		  	If you just created an account in step 1 above you will already be logged in, otherwise:
		    <ol>
		      <li>Click <a href="https://icpc.baylor.edu/private/dashboard">here</a>. (Or click on the "Login"-link on the <a href="http://icpc.baylor.edu/" target="_blank">main ICPC-page</a>).</li>
		      <li>Fill in your email and password and click "Sign in".</li>
		  </ol>
		  </p>

		  <p><b>Step 3 (register your team):</b><br />
		    On the <a href="https://icpc.baylor.edu/private/dashboard">Dashboard</a>:

			  	</ol>
		      <li>Create your team(s):<br />
		        <ol>
		          <li>If you are a Student Coach, check the "I also want to participate as contestant" box.</li>
		          <li>Your university should already be filled in (but if not, see <b>Step 1</b> above).</li>
		          <li>If you are not a Student Coach, fill in the number of teams you want to register.</li>
		          <li>Fill your team names. (This can be changed later)</li>
			      <li>Click on Next.</li>
			    </ol>
		      <li>Add team members:<br />
			    <ol>
			      <li>Click on "Add team member" (to the far right) for each additional contestant.</li>
                  <li>A block will appear with the string "Team member N". Click on it so that it expands.</li>
                  <li>In the "Find person" field you can search for team members that already have an ICPC-account. You can search by email (recommended) or name. If the person is found, click on the name, if not, click "Register new person".</li>
                  <li>In the "Role" field enter "Contestant".</li>
