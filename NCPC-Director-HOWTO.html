<h2>After NWERC</h2>

    <li>Make sure you have a Head of Jury, and a Tecnical Director.</li>

    <li>Go trough 
        <a href="orgstatus.html">orgstatus.html</a>,
        set a proper schedule, and update the document.</li>
    <li>Go through the mailing lists 
        <a href="http://ifi-lists.uio.no/mailman/listinfo/ncpc-info@ifi.uio.no">ncpc-info</a>,

        Send out an e-mail to each list, asking if anybody sees anybody on the

<ul>
    <li>Give ncpc-problems friendly reminders about the schedule. These should
        be frequent enough to keep the problem set at the back of peoples heads,
        but not frequent enough to be annoying.</li>

        speed.</li>
    <li>Set up a communication channel to use during the contest. Preferrably 
        an IRC channel on a server which is not in a network.</li>

</ul>

<h2>During the contest</h2>
<ul>
  
Kattis accounts for the contestants will be sent to you tomorrow. You will also receive 5 extra account for last minute teams or other unexpected events. Information about how to obtain a judge account for Kattis will be provided later.

Here are some instructions regarding Saturday:
1. Make sure that each contestant account is reset and only contains
   the sample input and output for all problems (will be distributed
   with the problem set tomorrow).  I suggest you create one directory
   for each problem.  At each work station place three copies of the
   problem set in an envelop.

2. Read the rules and inform the contestants before the competition
   about what is allowed and what is not.  For example, it is not
   allowed to use any other programming languages and code generation
   tools besides C/C++/Java.  The teams are allowed to use those
   shells, editors and IDEs that you provide them with.  However
   Python, Perl, lex, yacc and so on are not allowed. The contestants
   may use the documentation provided in Kattis (including STL and Java
   doc) as well as man pages if you have them.

3. Before the competition starts the contestants are allowed to log
   in, start a browser, start an editor if they want and log in on
   Kattis (https://ncpc12.contest.scrool.se/).  Nothing else.  No
   configuration files may be edited and the problem set is not to be
   touched.

4. All contest directors should report to me that they are ready to
   start the competition at the latest 10.50 Swedish time.  If you have
   problems please report those as soon as possible. You can report on
   the IRC channel (irc.acc.umu.se#ncpc), through email
   (fredrik.heintz@liu.se), or by calling me (+46-70-207 43 88). Since
   there are many sites this year we will probably start the contest
   even if one or two sites are silent. Unless something unexpected
   happens KTH will make a countdown on the IRC channel and at 11.00.00
   local KTH time the competition will start.

5. When the contest is started the contestants are allowed to open the
   problem set and start using the computer.  Do your best to monitor
   that they do not use any illegal programs or surf the web.  All the
   documentation that they are allowed to use is linked from their
   Kattis account.

6. All clarifications are handled through Kattis.  The head judges Jon
   Marius Venstad and Tommy FÃ¤rnqvist are responsible for answering all
   clarifications. They might be discussed on IRC if needed.  If the
   answer is of general interest then an email will be sent to all
   directors.

7. When the competition is over and the final result is ready, I will
   announce it on IRC and to all directors by email.  This is expected
   to be shortly after 16.00 unless something unexpected happens.
